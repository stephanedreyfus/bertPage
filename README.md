# bertPage
A bootstrap using personal web page for my father. (So far!)

This is the skeleton for what will be a gateway to [Professor Dreyfus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Dreyfus) teaching archives.
Hopefully, in the future, this archive will allow:
* Access to links to specific online resources
* A searchable database of lectures and publications

For now it is a rudimentary site meant to garner input from family members so that it can
be properly modified to please them as much as possible.
